meerkat
=======

Small and simple csv table abstraction for easy teaching the beginners. 

Why we need meerkat?
--------------------

It's being created because great Pandas is too sophisticated for the
begginers and plain csv module is too low-level (actually it's not
a table abstraction at all). Meerkat serves as a teaching module for
the data wrangling workshops for beginners.
